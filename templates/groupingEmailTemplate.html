      <p>Dear {{emergencyContact1Name}},</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We hope you are well and your children are excited for camp next week!
        Beforehand, we would like to share some pre-camp information to help you
        prepare:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        1. <strong>{{firstName}} {{lastName}}</strong> has been provisionally
        placed in <strong>{{weekGroup}}</strong> for the week.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="italic-grey"
          >As the groupings are done primarily by age, it is not always possible
          to meet all grouping requests particularly if the friends/siblings are
          of different ages.</span
        >
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        2. Drop-off is between 8:30 - 9:00 am. Pick-up is from 1:45 - 2:00 pm.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="italic-grey"
          >All parents/guardians need to drop off and pick up the children
          to/from the classrooms directly. Please inform the group leader of any
          alternative arrangements you may have for pick-up.</span
        >
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        3. The schedule of activities will be available for you to check on
        Monday in the reception area at drop-off.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="italic-grey"
          >Kindly note there will be no swimming scheduled for the Summer
          camp.</span
        >
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        4. We ask that all students bring 2 snacks and a packed lunch; please do
        not pack any foods containing nuts. Please ensure your child also has a
        refillable water bottle with them at all times.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        5. All children are required to come dressed in comfortable clothing and
        closed-toed shoes for activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="italic-grey"
          >We ask that all children below 5 years old bring a spare change of
          clothes with them to camp.</span
        >
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        6. We would like to politely request that children do not bring any
        technological devices or toys to Camp, as this will help to eliminate
        distractions during the activities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        7. The children will have water/splash games this week. Please refer to
        the timetable displayed on Monday to see which day they are scheduled.
        Be sure to pack extra clothes appropriate for the activity.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        8. The theme of week 2 is ‚ÄúSafari Week!‚Äù, come dressed as your favourite
        animal!; costumes, animal print, feathers and face paint!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>

        We look forward to seeing you soon!
